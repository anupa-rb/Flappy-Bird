## 🧱 Technology & Dependencies

Depending on your implementation, your project may rely on one of:

- **Console-based** (e.g., using `iostream`, Windows console functions)  
  – Completely text‑based gameplay as in this example: console obstacles and bird control using Spacebar :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Graphical version** using libraries like:
  - SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for window, sprite, input, and audio handling :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
  - OpenGL / GLUT for simple graphical rendering in C++ :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

Choose whichever corresponds to your codebase.
